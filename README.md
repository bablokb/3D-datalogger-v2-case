A case for the Pico-Datalogger v2
=================================

This project provides the 3D-design-files (OpenSCAD) for a case
for the Pico Datalogger (see https://github.com/bablokb/pcb-datalogger-v2).

The case is available for two versions: one for the very first
iteration of the v2-pcb with size 46x60mm (with revision 0.94, gray
buttons), and one for the second iteration with size 56x70mm (with
revision 2.10, red buttons).

Base with Pico, Lipo, Lipo-charger (front left) and LoRa-PCB (back
